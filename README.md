# 🧠 C++ Learning Projects

Welcome to my C++ learning repository!  
This repo contains small, focused projects I’ve built while learning **data structures**, **file handling**, and **C++ fundamentals**.  

Each project includes full source code, build instructions, and explanations.

## 📘 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ [Grade Calculation](./grade-calculation)
A simple C++ program that:
- Reads a list of grades from a text file (`grades.txt`)
- Calculates lab, quiz, midterm, and final averages
- Outputs the overall grade for the student

🧩 **Concepts practiced:**
- File I/O with `ifstream`
- Loops and arrays
- Functions and parameters
- Basic arithmetic logic

---

### 2️⃣ [Sibling Linked List](./sibling-list)
A linked list program that:
- Asks the user about their siblings (name, gender, age)
- Stores all siblings dynamically in a linked list
- Prints the list to both a file and the console

🧩 **Concepts practiced:**
- Classes and structs
- Pointers and dynamic memory
- Linked list traversal and deletion
- File output with `ofstream`

---

## 🛠️ How to Run Any Project

Each folder contains:
- `.cpp` source files
- A `Makefile` or VS Code configuration for building

You can compile and run from the terminal:

```bash
g++ *.cpp -o program
./program
```

## 💡 Tools Used
- Language: C++17
- Compiler: MinGW-w64 / GCC
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Platform: Windows 10 / 11 (portable to macOS or Linux)

## 🏁 Goals

This repository helped me to:
- Learn memory management and data structures
- Practice file input/output
